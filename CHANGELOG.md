# Weather Dashboard - Changelog

## [Simplified Version] - October 3, 2025

### 🎯 Project Simplification

**Philosophy**: Keeping the app simple, focused on core weather functionality without user accounts or complex features.

### ✂️ Removed Features & Infrastructure

#### **Database & ORM**
- ❌ Removed Prisma ORM (`@prisma/client`, `prisma`)
- ❌ Deleted PostgreSQL integration
- ❌ Removed `prisma/schema.prisma` file
- ❌ Removed `src/lib/prisma.ts` client
- ❌ Removed `DATABASE_URL` from environment variables
- **Reason**: No user accounts means no need for persistent storage

#### **Unused Dependencies**
- ❌ Removed Axios (`axios`)
- **Reason**: Already replaced with native Fetch API

#### **Redux State Features**
- ❌ Removed `theme` from user preferences
- ❌ Removed `favoriteLocations` from user preferences
- ❌ Removed `setTheme` action
- ❌ Removed `addFavoriteLocation` action
- ❌ Removed `removeFavoriteLocation` action
- **Reason**: These features required user authentication and database persistence
